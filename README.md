# Python Test Automation Proving Ground
On this repository you can find python tests and test automation put to use.

I've created this only for practice, so I can test new techniques and concepts around test automation.

Feel free to copy, change, use an learn. But if you don't change anything and distribute, remember to
give credits from where you got it.

Happy Coding!
